**Honesty check - what runs today:** The firmware builds in the ESP-IDF 5.5.5 container, its core (the settings, the exchange with each kind of equipment, the arithmetic of the emulated UART, the Bluetooth channel, the release and signature checks: 10,527 checks in 14 test programs) is tested on a computer with stand-in equipment, the messages it makes are accepted by ARMOR-COMMON and the panel was exercised in a browser against a stand-in node. **It has never run on a board and no inverter or battery has been connected**: the Wi-Fi, the panel over TLS, the update, the hardware and emulated UARTs and the formats of the protocols (written from public documents and from memory) are untried. The ANT-BMS frames in its tests were captured by other people on their own units: this project has not read one itself.

## 🎯 Overview

* **Two boards, one firmware:** an ESP32-S3-WROOM-1 N16R8 on Wi-Fi (the default) and the Waveshare ESP32-S3-ETH on its Ethernet cable (DHCP or a fixed address; its own Wi-Fi network is kept to reach it from a phone). The image is chosen when it is built (`tools/build_node.sh generic s3-wifi` or `generic s3-eth`); the pin table, the default pins of the ports and the way in follow the board, and an image is only for its own board. Both build and are host-tested; neither has run on a board.
* **The firmware of the node** (ESP32-S3-WROOM-1 N16R8 on Wi-Fi, or the Waveshare ESP32-S3-ETH on its cable): ten serial ports, three hardware UARTs and seven emulated ones (up to 19200 baud), each independent and each reading an inverter, a battery or a raw monitor, so a node may read only inverters, only batteries or a mix.
* **The node's web panel,** the radar nodes' too: set-up with a code shown on the USB console, login and users, Wi-Fi (station and access point), broker, update over the air with rollback, log, HTTPS, and the pages of the ports (with what each one hears, for protocols not decoded yet) and of the readings, in eight languages.
* **Voltronic / MPP Solar inverters** (Axpert, PIP, InfiniSolar and clones), RS232 at 2400 baud: the frames and their CRC, and the readings `QPIGS` (grid, output, battery, PV, status bits), `QMOD` (mode), `QPIWS` (warnings and faults by name) and `QPIRI` (ratings). Only reading commands can be built: a setting changes how the house is fed. Three dialects, chosen on the port or found by it (*auto*): PI30, REVO (another `QPIGS`, checksum replies) and PI18 (`^P005GS`: InfiniSolar V, LV5048, SunGoldPower), read only.
* **Pylontech batteries** (US2000, US3000, US5000): the console's `pwr` table (every module's voltage, current, temperatures and state of charge), `bat <n>` (the voltage and temperature of every cell) and `info <n>` (model, remaining and full capacity, cycles), summarised as one stack with its total capacity and energy, and the RS485 frame with its two checks. The formats are written from memory of the public console and may differ between firmwares. The columns are found by the header's names (the US5000 V2.3 layout with its Id columns, MosTempr and SysAlarm.St included), the remaining charge and the balancing come from `bat`, and the model, rated capacity and cycles from `info` and `stat`, asked once and kept for half an hour.
* **What a Pylontech module tells about itself:** its model and the versions of its board and software, its cells and the current it allows, the counters of its life (`stat`), the health of each cell (`soh`, the abnormal one marked) and the newest entry of its event log, with the protection names exactly as the console prints them. The console only reads, and an administrator can download what a port heard as a text file.
* **The messages of the node** (`armor/solar/<node>/<device>/state`, one per inverter or battery stack), defined in ARMOR-COMMON with schemas and conformance vectors; what the ports make is checked against them.
* **ANT-BMS batteries** (the black boards of home-made packs, 7S to 32S), 3.3 V UART at 19200 baud: both protocols of its firmware (the node asks in one and then in the other and keeps to the one that answers), with the cells, temperatures, state of charge, current, capacities and the states of the MOSFETs and the balancer, checked against frames captured on four real models. Reading only: its write commands can disconnect a battery under load. A button on the ports page also reads the BMS's model, version and 56 protection and balancing settings (newer protocol), read only.
* **Configuration from a phone over Bluetooth,** the same channel as the radar node's: the ARMOR app finds the node as `ARMOR-XXXXXX` and sets its name, Wi-Fi, address, broker and Bluetooth mode with the panel's users and set-up code ([the protocol](docs/BLE_PROVISIONING.md)). It listens only while the node has no user, unless told otherwise. The radio side has never run on a board.
* **The base board with multiplexers (the *mux* profile):** three hardware UARTs, each behind a 74HC4052, serve up to eight ports in groups of 4, 2 and 2 that take turns on their line, each port with its own speed and polarity, and one LED per port through a 74HC595; the cells of a tall Pylontech stack can be read in rotation. For an inverter in the standard dialect, the **second PV input** (`QPIGS2`) and the **units of a parallel system** (`QPGS`) are optional readings. None of it has run on a board.
* **Signed over-the-air updates:** the node installs from GitHub only an image whose SHA-256 matches and that carries a valid Ed25519 signature of the maintainer (the public key is in the firmware, the private one never leaves the maintainer); a file uploaded by hand by an administrator in the panel is still accepted. The pages and messages of the panel are in eight languages.
* **Bluetooth pairing with a PIN:** the six-digit PIN is derived from the set-up code, printed on the USB console and shown to an administrator in the panel; the phone has to enter it before it may write the node's settings.
* **Not yet:** the ANT-BMS's Bluetooth link (the node uses the cable, the more stable of the two) and a run on a real board with real equipment.
* **Only the house may use the panel:** the panel answers the private network by default (or the networks its owner lists, such as a VPN), refuses a list that would lock out whoever saves it, counts wrong passwords for each person as well as each address, and works behind the server's proxy so that it can be reached from outside the house without publishing the node.**Unknown is not none:** a REVO inverter has no warning query, so its message carries `warnings_known: false` and Studio shows the warnings as unknown instead of "none".
* **Optional encrypted link to the broker (TLS):** off by default, so the node talks plain MQTT as before. A switch and a box for the certificate of the installation's own authority (PEM, at most 2 KB) in the Broker page make it connect with `mqtts://`, trust that authority only and check that the broker's certificate was made for the address it reached; anything that is not one PEM certificate is refused. Covered by host tests; the handshake has not been run on a board yet.
* **Health report:** about once a minute the node publishes how long it has been up and why it last restarted, its free memory, its link and Wi-Fi signal, how many times it connected to the broker and the last error it logged (`armor/health/<node>`, the `node_health` contract of ARMOR-COMMON). The code that builds it is shared by every node and tested on a computer; it has not run on a board.
* **Writing to Pylontech batteries (off by default):** typed operations only - clock, counters and logs, restart, capacity, the reset of the charge level, limits and protections, outputs, serial number, external memory, firmware by XMODEM-1K and an expert console with a block list - in two steps (arm, then execute with a one-time token), with the battery read before and after, the service password kept only in the node and a simulated console for the tests. Untried on a real battery: see the [bench test plan](docs/BATTERY_BENCH_TEST_PLAN.md).
* **Control from the server:** Studio can restart the node cleanly, pause it for up to an hour (it resumes by itself), put its work in standby (no end, kept across restarts, the node stays connected and keeps answering), make it show itself, ask for a diagnostics snapshot and mark it as in maintenance (`armor/control/<node>/...`, the `node_control` contract of ARMOR-COMMON). Every order takes two steps with a one-time token that belongs to that operation, only the server may write them on the broker, and there is no factory reset, no erase and no deep sleep. While the node is paused or in standby it writes no battery (a running operation can still be cancelled) and keeps reading the inverters and batteries. The code is shared by every node and tested on a computer; it has not run on a board.
* **Absurd values are named, not hidden:** when an inverter sends a number beyond what is possible, the node holds it at the contract's limit and names it in `clamped`, so the server shows it as not real; and the raw dump of a port is only made while the panel is looking at it.
* **Diagnostics without a cable:** after a start that was not clean (a crash, a watchdog, a sag of the supply, a failed allocation) the health report says why for ten minutes; a crash leaves its core dump to look at, download or erase from the panel; the stored settings are copied before every firmware install and recovered if an update damages them; and an administrator can ask the node, through the server, for a diagnostic package or its log with a one-time token.
* **Optional sealing of stored secrets:** off by default (`security.seal_secrets`, or the server's `nodes.nvs_encryption`). When on, the passwords, tokens, keys, PINs and password hashes the node stores are kept sealed with ChaCha20-Poly1305 and everything else stays readable; turning it on or off rewrites them with nothing lost, even if the node stops half-way. No eFuse is burned and the flash is not encrypted: the key lives in a partition of the same chip, so it does **not** protect against someone who holds the board, and a node installed before that partition existed keeps its secrets as they were until it is flashed with the new partition table.

## 🧩 Role in A.R.M.O.R.

ARMOR-NODE-SOLAR is the gateway between the house's solar equipment and the family. It reads inverters and batteries through up to ten serial ports and publishes what it reads for [ARMOR-SERVER](https://github.com/JuanenRac/ARMOR-SERVER), which keeps the history, the sums and the alarms; the *Inverters* and *Batteries* menus of [ARMOR-STUDIO](https://github.com/JuanenRac/ARMOR-STUDIO) and the Solar screen of [ARMOR-ANDROID-CONTROL](https://github.com/JuanenRac/ARMOR-ANDROID-CONTROL) show it. It only reads: it never writes a setting to any equipment.
